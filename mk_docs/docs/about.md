# About AutoMate

## Project Overview

AutoMate is an advanced voice and text control system that allows you to control your computer using natural language instructions. Developed as part of an MLOps course project, AutoMate demonstrates the practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for everyday computing tasks.

## The Team
We are
- Vishnu Shreeram (142201014)
- Dhruvadeep Malakar (142201026)
- DODDAPANENI UDITH (142201012)

Our team have worked together to create a comprehensive system that integrates various technologies:

- **LLM Integration**: Implemented Ollama with Qwen2.5 model for natural language understanding
- **Browser Control**: Developed browser automation using Playwright
- **Hardware Access**: Created hardware interaction tools for system monitoring and camera control
- **Unified Logging**: Built a centralized logging system to simplify debugging and monitoring

## Development Journey

Developing AutoMate has been a significant learning experience for our team. This project represents our first large-scale system with multiple interconnected components working together.

### Challenges and Learnings

Throughout the development process, we faced several challenges that led to valuable learnings:

- **Coordinating Microservices**: Managing communication between the LLM service, browser control, and hardware services required careful architecture planning
- **Tool Integration**: Creating a cohesive system where tools could be dynamically called by the LLM agent
- **Error Handling**: Building robust error handling across distributed components
- **Configuration Management**: Learning to use YAML and TOML for flexible configuration without code changes

### DevOps Practices

The project enabled us to implement and learn several DevOps best practices:

- **Git Workflow**: Managing branches, pull requests, and merges in a team environment
- **Code Quality Tools**: Using Ruff for linting and code quality enforcement
- **Package Management**: Leveraging uv for dependency management and environment setup
- **Containerization**: Exploring container-based deployment for individual services
- **Documentation**: Creating comprehensive documentation with MkDocs
