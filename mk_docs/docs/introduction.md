# Introduction to AutoMate

## Project Overview

AutoMate is an intelligent computer control system that bridges natural language interactions with computer operations through Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables users to control their systems via commands, automating tasks that would typically require multiple manual steps.

## Purpose & Vision

The goal of AutoMate is to create a seamless interface between human intent and computer actions. By leveraging the capabilities of modern LLMs, AutoMate interprets natural language queries and translates them into appropriate system actions, allowing for a more intuitive human-computer interaction.

## Core Capabilities

AutoMate is built around several key capabilities:

### Natural Language Understanding

Using the Qwen2.5 model via Ollama, AutoMate can parse and understand a wide range of instructions phrased in natural language. The system identifies the user's intent and maps it to specific system tools and actions.

### Tool-Based Architecture

AutoMate uses a tool-calling architecture where the LLM determines which tools to invoke based on user input. The system includes tools for:

- **Browser control**: Opening, searching, and closing web browsers
- **Hardware interaction**: Taking screenshots and accessing the camera
- **System monitoring**: Checking CPU, RAM, and disk usage

### Modular Design

The system is built with modularity in mind, separating concerns into distinct services:

- **LLM Service**: Handles natural language understanding and tool selection
- **Browser Service**: Controls web browser operations
- **Hardware Service**: Interfaces with system hardware components
- **Logging Service**: Provides unified logging across all components

## Use Cases

AutoMate is particularly useful for:

1. **Efficiency gains**: Perform multi-step tasks with a single command
2. **Accessibility**: Make computer operations more accessible to users with limited technical knowledge
3. **Remote control**: Manage systems through text commands from a distance

## Project Context

AutoMate was developed as part of an MLOps course to demonstrate the practical application of LLMs in everyday computing. It showcases how modern AI techniques can be integrated with traditional system operations to create new interaction paradigms.
